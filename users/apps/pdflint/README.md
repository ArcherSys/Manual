## What is PDFLint

PDFLint is a powerful word processor that can be used for just about anything school-related that you can think of. The word processor was very useful when I had to do summer reading essays for school, and the notes for APUSH. 

## How much does it cost on the [ArcherSys OS Apporium](https://apporium-acosf.c9.io/apps)?
Virtually, it costs absolutely nothing.


## Anything Interesting about the PDFLint Word Processor?
Yes! It is also a PHP Composer package (Packagist)! The  best thing about this package is that it has the best document creator, Dropbox support, a file browser, and more.
