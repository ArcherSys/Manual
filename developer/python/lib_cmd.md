# Using the Cmd Python Module To Develop ArcherSys OS 
You will be making a CLI Application using the Cmd Module
## What does the console have to do with making native ArcherSys Applications?
The console is one of the most beautiful Environments to work with. Why? Because the console has hidden treasures that make an application so nicely.To Do it using APIs and that module, type this:
```
from KPython.Lib.archersys.contrib.externalized.core import AbstractActivityKernel 
# API for activity here
```
or 
```
from Lib.archersys.contrib.externalized.core import AbstractActivityKernel
# API for activity here
```
This is Python. The first one was KPython, or ArcherVMPeridot Python. To create an ActivityKernel, do this:

```
class MyActivityKernel(AbstractActvityKernel):
    
```
