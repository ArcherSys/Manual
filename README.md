## What is ArcherSys?
ArcherSys OS is a powerful OS in the form of a website.It has a powerful word processor with a ternimal experience fitted with Git, VENV-Built Python, MIT R, Uru, Ruby, Mozilla Rust, and more.

Generation: II
Features
==========
## Open Source Apps
1. ### Piwik
 Piwik is used as a tracking application for applications. Sometime during 2015, there could be a PHP static method in the LogicManager object that adds the code for the tracking features for that.
2. ### Wordpress
 Wordpress makes up many app package portals. Those portals usually have menus that link up to applications inside the same folder as the Wordpress appliation for ArcherSys OS, and they are used for ArcherSocial, WebMyAdmin, and more.
3. ### Owncloud
  Owncloud has been in the ArcherSys OS since the start date of the OS: September 2nd, 2014. It has helped organize some media files, and provides a great interface for organizing documents, code files, and your schedule. It has also implemented SQLite3, making it the first ArcherSys OS Application to do so.
4. ### phpMyAdmin 
  The admin interface that can blow anyone away if it has features like ReCAPTCHA, or Bootstrap. Usually used for creating th data for the PHP Codebase to use, the Admin Interface has helped with install 26 ArcherVMs At Mckinley Technology High School.
## Languages
1. ### Codecademy-Standard
   These are languages that I have learned on Codecademy.com over the course of almost two years straight. They are:
   1. #### Python
  
      Python is a language that has helped this operating system grow since January 23rd, 2015. The Language has brought the terminal experience to the OS by using code libraries and pip to create interactive expereinces that are useful, and easy.
   2. #### PHP (External)
     PHP is the language that makes up an advanced ArcherSys OS Application. Those Apps Are server side, and they also use Something called Apache HTTPD. Without Apache and PHP, this OS would not be possible. The Anaconda Framework when it was alive and well was used to create error messages for when a database problem occured or when there was no connection at all. The PHP Applications makeup most of the codebase for a good reason. 
   3. #### Ruby
     Ruby is a legend and a trooper of a language to have gotten this far in it's relationship with ArcherCraft Standard Software Products. Before the ArcherSys OS ArcherVMs were first developed, the ArcherVMs were named after gems, and there also was a RubyGem that actually was a Rails Application.The RubyGem was called ArcherPlume, and it was a blogging application that was less fancier than Twitter at the time. Ruby was cut of it duties after a while due to path-related problems, but faired pretty well for its size and appearance.
2. ### Non-Codecademy-Standard
   1. #### Rust
      This is a special language for the promise that was fufilled for the Rust language that was on the CodeQuiz Android Application for ArcherSys Walnut (AppInventor).
